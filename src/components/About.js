                <p>A production engineer (insert any other buzzwords here like 'DevOps') trying to learn a little bit of everything (and failing for obvious reasons). I have solid knowledge in every topic listed at `/skills` </p>

                <p>I'm also enthusiast in open-source contributions, eBPF technology applied to observability and 2D game development. </p>

                <p>Feel free to get in touch to exchange experiences. (: </p>
